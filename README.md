# Uber-Trip-Analysis
This project dives deep into the pickup patterns of Uber rides in New York City between 2014 and 2015. Using time series analysis and machine learning, we uncover insights and trends that can fuel smarter urban planning and business decisions.

## Project Overview

The **Uber Trip Analysis** project focuses on:

- Understanding temporal and spatial trends in Uber pickups
- Performing **time series forecasting** on ride volumes
- Building **ensemble ML models** to predict demand
- Visualizing patterns for improved interpretability

This analysis is especially helpful for logistics companies, urban developers, and enthusiasts of data storytelling.
